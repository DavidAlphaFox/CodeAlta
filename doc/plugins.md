# Plugin Abstractions

CodeAlta exposes a public plugin authoring package in `src/CodeAlta.Plugins.Abstractions` and foundational runtime services in `src/CodeAlta.Plugins`. The runtime currently provides source package discovery, generated plugin-root build files, explicit enablement resolution, structured `dotnet build plugin.cs` orchestration, collectible assembly-load-context loading, descriptor discovery, contribution ownership, built-in plugin metadata, lifecycle helpers, file-system change monitoring, runtime diagnostics, startup planning, concrete contribution adapters, management view-model data/dialog routing, and source-change notifications.

A simple plugin usually references only `CodeAlta.Plugins.Abstractions`, inherits from `PluginBase`, and overrides the contribution methods it needs:

```csharp
using CodeAlta.Plugins.Abstractions;
using XenoAtom.Terminal.UI.Controls;
using CliCommand = XenoAtom.CommandLine.Command;

[Plugin(DisplayName = "Hello Plugin", Description = "Adds a command, prompt guidance, and status row.")]
public sealed class HelloPlugin : PluginBase
{
    public override IEnumerable<PluginCommandContribution> GetCommands()
    {
        yield return Command.Prompt(
            "hello",
            "Show a hello notification.",
            static async (context, cancellationToken) =>
            {
                await context.Ui.NotifyAsync("Hello from a plugin.", cancellationToken);
                return PluginCommandResult.Handled;
            });
    }

    public override IEnumerable<PluginSystemPromptContribution> GetSystemPromptContributions()
    {
        yield return Prompt.Developer("When the user asks about the hello plugin, explain that it is installed.");
    }

    public override IEnumerable<XenoAtom.CommandLine.CommandNode> GetCommandLineContributions()
    {
        yield return new CliCommand("hello", "Run hello plugin command-line actions.");
    }

    public override IEnumerable<PluginUiContribution> GetUiContributions()
    {
        yield return PluginUi.Status("Hello", static _ => "hello plugin active");
        yield return PluginUi.Visual(PluginUiRegion.ThreadFooter, static _ => new Markup("[dim]Hello plugin[/]"));
    }
}
```

## v1 authoring model

- A plugin is a concrete `PluginBase` subclass with a public parameterless constructor.
- `PluginAttribute` metadata is optional; a runtime can derive descriptor data from the assembly and type.
- `readme.md` package documentation is optional, not required for discovery or activation.
- A single assembly can contain multiple plugin classes.
- `PluginDiscovery` exposes helper predicates for the runtime rule: visible, concrete, non-generic `PluginBase` subclasses with public parameterless constructors.
- `PluginScope` is assigned by the runtime from the load location, not by plugin code: `~/.alta/plugins` produces global plugins, while `{project}/.alta/plugins` produces project-scoped plugins.
- Project-scoped plugins expose `ScopeProjectId` / `ScopeProjectPath` through `PluginRuntimeContext` and operation contexts so the runtime can restrict prompt injections, commands, resources, and other contributions to the matching project.
- Contributions are declarative objects returned from virtual methods; the runtime owns registration and removal.
- Simple contributions do not require author-supplied IDs. The runtime creates contribution handles from plugin identity, contribution point, natural names, and ordinals.
- Plugins receive a direct `XenoAtom.Logging.Logger` through `PluginRuntimeContext` and `PluginBase.Logger`.

## Source plugin runtime layout

Dynamic source plugins are discovered under these roots:

- `~/.alta/plugins/<package-id>/plugin.cs` for global plugins;
- `<project>/.alta/plugins/<package-id>/plugin.cs` for project-scoped plugins.

For each plugin root, CodeAlta owns generated root-level build files: `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `Directory.Packages.props`, and `global.json`. The generated `global.json` selects the .NET 10 SDK required for native file-based builds; generated props force file-based plugins to build as `net10.0` libraries with `EnableDynamicLoading=true`; generated targets reference host CodeAlta assemblies from the running executable folder with `<Private>false</Private>`, shared authoring packages with explicit versions and `<ExcludeAssets>runtime</ExcludeAssets>`, and a deterministic `CodeAltaPluginTargetPath` message for output discovery; generated package props disable central package management so `#:package Package@Version` directives work normally. CodeAlta invokes `dotnet build plugin.cs` directly from the plugin package directory; the plugin-root `global.json` is still found by normal SDK ancestor lookup. CodeAlta lets the .NET SDK choose its own file-based build output/cache location; the resolved output assembly is recorded in CodeAlta's plugin build manifest for fast subsequent loads. Source plugin packages should not contain their own `Directory.Build.props`, `Directory.Build.targets`, `Directory.Packages.props`, or `global.json`; the runtime diagnoses those files as unsupported for v1 source-folder plugins.

Dynamic source plugins are trusted code. Building a plugin can execute SDK/NuGet/MSBuild logic, and loading it executes .NET code in the CodeAlta process. Source plugins are enabled by default when discovered; disable a plugin through TOML configuration when you do not want it built or loaded:

```toml
[plugins.HelloWorld]
enabled = false
```

Use `--no-plugins`, `--plugin-safe-mode`, or `CODEALTA_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1` to bypass plugin discovery/build/load when a plugin is broken. These switches are host-owned and are recognized before plugin-contributed command-line options.

Plugin diagnostics are stored and displayed separately from normal conversation history. Runtime status includes config/discovery/build/load/activation/contribution/callback/source-change/unload diagnostics, structured build summaries, contribution summaries, and unknown config entries. Use `/plugins` or `/plugin` (or the command palette entry) to open plugin management for the current scope. Use `--plugins-status` for a headless discovery/config summary suitable for CI troubleshooting.

## Contribution areas

The abstraction package includes contracts for:

- early startup hooks and command-line contributions using `XenoAtom.CommandLine` nodes;
- shell, prompt, and thread commands with shortcut/presentation metadata;
- UI visuals, status rows, dialogs, and renderer hooks using XenoAtom `Visual` types;
- prompt processors, system/developer prompt parts, and before-agent-run hooks;
- LLM-callable agent tools and tool call/result interception;
- backend/provider factories returning `IAgentBackend`;
- plugin-lifetime background tasks through `IPluginTaskService` so the runtime can block unload until tracked work completes;
- resource roots such as skills, system prompts, templates, themes, MCP manifests, and agent definitions;
- compaction hooks for before/instruction/reducer/after participation;
- normalized agent event observation;
- diagnostics, lifecycle states, context invalidation, and no-op/headless service implementations.

Low-ceremony factories are available for common authoring tasks: `Command`, `Startup`, `Prompt`, `Attachments`, `PluginUi`, `Resources`, `Tool`, and `PluginBackend`.
`PluginUi` also creates dialog requests for notifications, confirmations, input text, text editor dialogs, selections, and custom visuals.
Command-line contributions intentionally use plain `XenoAtom.CommandLine` objects such as `Command` and `CommandGroup`, with options, arguments, validation, completion, and callbacks added through the command-line API directly instead of a CodeAlta-specific wrapper.

Plugins should schedule long-running background work through `Services.Tasks.Run(...)` or the `PluginBase.Tasks` shortcut instead of calling `Task.Run` directly. The runtime tracks these handles, cancels them during deactivation, and can delay unload while `PluginTaskHandle.Completion` is still running.

## Backend/provider example

```csharp
public override IEnumerable<PluginAgentBackendContribution> GetAgentBackends()
{
    yield return PluginBackend.FromFactory(
        name: "example-backend",
        displayName: "Example Backend",
        description: "Adds a custom provider protocol.",
        capabilities: PluginAgentBackendCapabilities.Default | PluginAgentBackendCapabilities.Tools,
        factory: static async (context, cancellationToken) =>
        {
            await context.Services.State.WriteJsonAsync(PluginStateScope.User, "last-start.json", DateTimeOffset.UtcNow, cancellationToken);
            return new ExampleAgentBackend(context.Logger);
        });
}
```

The runtime will decide where contributed backends appear in provider selection and how collisions with built-in providers are diagnosed.

## Resource example

```csharp
public override IEnumerable<PluginResourceContribution> GetResources()
{
    yield return Resources.SkillRoot("skills");
    yield return Resources.SystemPromptRoot("prompts");
}
```

Relative resource paths are interpreted relative to the plugin package directory by the runtime.

## Troubleshooting runtime startup

- **Missing or unsupported SDK:** source plugins require a .NET 10 SDK and the plugin-root `global.json` generated by CodeAlta so `dotnet build plugin.cs` is handled as a native file-based C# build. If a build diagnostic says `dotnet build plugin.cs` was treated as a project file (`The project file could not be loaded`), install a supported .NET 10 SDK, restore the plugin root `global.json`, or start CodeAlta with `--plugin-safe-mode` / `--no-plugins`. CodeAlta does not generate a replacement project fallback for source plugins.
- **Build failures:** startup prints a concise failure list with source paths and the log file location. Full per-plugin runtime diagnostics and captured stdout/stderr tails are written to `~/.alta/logs/codealta.log`. CodeAlta does not pass MSBuild logger/node-reuse switches to `dotnet build plugin.cs` because the .NET 10 file-based build path treats those forwarded MSBuild switches as project-build mode in current SDKs; stdout parsing is limited to the deterministic `CodeAltaPluginTargetPath=` message emitted by CodeAlta's generated target for output assembly discovery.
- **Dependency load failures:** CodeAlta assemblies and shared authoring dependencies resolve from the host default load context. Plugin-owned package dependencies must be copied by the SDK (`EnableDynamicLoading=true`) so the plugin `AssemblyLoadContext` can resolve them from the plugin output folder.
- **Unload delays or failures:** tracked plugin tasks are cancelled during deactivation and unload waits are bounded. Unload can still fail if plugin code keeps static references, untracked background work, pinned native resources, or host-static delegates alive.
- **Safe mode:** `--no-plugins`, `--plugin-safe-mode`, and `CODEALTA_DISABLE_PLUGINS=1` are checked before dynamic plugins build or load, so they remain available even when a plugin is broken.
